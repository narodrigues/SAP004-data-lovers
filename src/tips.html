          <h3 class="subtitles" >A Brief Story About Pokémon Go</h3>
          <br>
          <article>
          Pokémon Go is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed and published by Niantic
          in collaboration with The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices. <br>
          It uses the mobile device GPS to locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, 
          called Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. <br>
          The game is free to play; it uses a freemium business model and supports in-app purchases 
          for additional in-game items. The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which 
          had increased to around 500 by 2019.

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Starter Tips</h3>
          <br>
          <article>
            <strong>Here are some general tips that you should know when you start playing Pokémon Go:</strong><br><br>
            • You can start the game with Pikachu by continually ignoring and walking past the three starter Pokémon
            You'll have to do this at least for times, so be patient;<br><br>
            • In addition to Items, XP, and Gym leadership, you can also earn small XP rewards and prestige by collecting Medals;<br><br>
            • PokeStops are the best place to find free new Items, and public areas like Parks, Malls, 
            or shopping areas are most likely to be PokeStops;<br><br>
            • Pokémon tend to haunt common geographic areas. You'll likely find water Pokémon near water, but more importantly, 
            you'll often find specific water Pokémon near specific bodies of water. Get to know your local area and find out where Pokémon are appearing;<br><br>
            • Pokémon can be personalized, and sometimes a Pokémon's name can actually have an effect on their evolutions;<br><br>
            • Duplicate Pokémon can be traded in for Candy and then used to help evolve other Pokémon. 
            Duplicates can also be saved for Evolution runs to rapidly gain XP;<br><br>
            • When visiting a PokeStop, spin the disc at the center of the screen, then pop the bubbles that emerge for free items;<br><br>
            • PokeStops restore after only a few minutes. You can use any blue PokeStop to find Items. Pink PokeStops are temporarily recharging;<br><br>
            • Tall grass often indicates that something is nearby, but it's not always a specific location for a Pokémon;

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Pokémon Go Team Tips</h3>
          <br>
          <article>
            Pokémon Go Teams are a core part of Gyms and Raids, and almost three years after the game first launched, it is possible to change them thanks to a Team Change Item named the Team Medallion.<br>
            Deciding which team to go with is an important decision - unlike changing your name or Trainer appearance, which is cosmetic only - it allows you to work with others to hold onto gyms, 
            earning you valuable in-game currency Pokémon Go Coins, and gives you a boost during capturing creatures after Raid battles.<br><br>
            <strong>How to choose and change teams in Pokémon Go?</strong><br><br>
            There are two methods of choosing your Pokémon Go team between Valor, Mystic and Instinct.<br>
            You're prompted to join a Pokémon Go team once your Trainer reaches Level 5 and you tap on a nearby Gym. <br>
            At this point, you'll be introduced to the three teams and leaders, 
            and after making a choice, that's the team you are aligned with.<br><br>
            <strong>What does your choice of Pokémon Go team do, and which is the best team?</strong><br><br>
            The only notable impact Pokémon Go Teams have on the game involve the Gyms and Raids. In Gyms, you fight on behalf of your team to take and hold the Gym with your own Pokémon, 
            and other team members can join in the attack or defense. <br>They also chat to you when you do CP Appraisals of your Pokemon, and while all three have their own phrases, each will grade them in the same way.
            Holding a Gym for a period of time grants you PokéCoins, the in-game currency that lets you buy a variety of bonuses that would normally cost you real money. 
            <br>Likewise, you also get some slightly better rewards for spinning the discs above any Gym owned by your team.<br>
            Perhaps more importantly, there are some extra Premier Balls for catching Raid Pokémon that appear above a Gym owned by your team - so if you can see an Egg countdown signalling the start of a Raid, 
            change it to your colour for an advantage! <br>Similarly, if it's your colour, try and defend it by feeding the creatures there Berries to stop it changing before the Raid begins.
            That is otherwise about it - Gyms and Raids is where Teams really come into play. <br>When Pokémon Go first launched, it was speculated by players that since a Legendary Bird was tied to each of the Teams as a mascot - 
            Zapdos for Instinct, Articuno for Mystic, and Moltres for Valor - along with a relatively obvious clue to Teams' significance in the Team leaders' names Spark, Blanche, and Candela, it was assumed their availability would be based on your specific team.
            <br>That is not the case - so don't expect any advantage or bonuses in this regard with your choice of team.<br><br>
            <strong>With all this in mind - which Pokémon Go team should you choose?</strong><br><br>
            Which Pokémon Go Team should you choose out of Valor, Mystic and Instinct?
            That's a hard one to answer, as all three teams have no specific inherent advantages.<br>
            A Teams' success seems to fall mostly on the one with the most players in any given area, and that in turn affects in-game bonuses with holding Gyms and battling in Raids.
            According to an Adobe Marketing Blog, the game saw Mystic as most popular to begin with. At the time of writing over two years on, antidotally Mystic (blue) and Valor (red) 
            are the most popular choices to choose from, with Instinct (yellow) widely seen as the underdog.<br>
            The best advice we have is that you join the same team as your friends and local community. If you can, discover who they are - participating in Community Day events will often see 
            everyone playing at once for a short period of time every month, but simply observing the behaviour of gyms over a period of time to see who is most dominant will also work without 
            having the need to interact with anyone, if you prefer.<br><br>
            <strong>Pokémon Go Teams Valor, Mystic, and Instinct - and their leaders</strong><br><br>
            If you are still undecided, then maybe taking a closer look at each of their personalities and personal 
            philosophy on Pokémon might help, as first revealed at 2016 San Diego Comic-Con.<br><br>
            <strong>Team Mystic - Blue - Articuno</strong><br><br>
            Team Mystic are led by Blanche, who has this to say:
            The wisdom of Pokémon is immeasurably deep. I'm researching why it is that they evolve. 
            My team? With our calm analysis of every situation, we can't lose!<br><br>
            <strong>Team Valor - Red - Moltres</strong><br><br>
            Headed up by Candela, Team Valor are apparently all about Pokémon's strength:<br>
            Pokémon are stronger than humans, and they're warmhearted, too! I'm researching ways to enhance Pokémon's natural power in the pursuit of true strength. 
            There's no doubt that the Pokémon our team have trained are the strongest in battle!<br><br>
            <strong>Team Instinct - Yellow - Zapdos</strong><br><br>
            Team Instinct - who presumably drew inspiration for their name from one of the teams on The Apprentice - are lead by a chap named Spark. Here's what he has to say:<br>
            Pokémon are creatures with excellent intuition. I bet the secret to their intuition is related to how they're hatched. Come and join my team. You never lose when you trust your instinct!<br><br>

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Pokeball Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Pokeballs are the most important item in Pokémon Go. Obviously, you’ll need them to catch Pokémon. There are three different kinds of Pokeballs that you can find. 
            The regular Pokeball is fairly ubiquitous but later levels allow you to unlock Great Balls, Master Balls, and Ultra Balls as well.<br><br>
            <strong>The main tips when you're talking about Pokeballs are:</strong><br><br>
              •	Tap a Poke Ball that missed its mark to clear it off the screen so you don't have to wait for it to roll away;<br><br>
              • Don't waste real money on Poke Balls. They're plentiful in PokeStops and also appear as rewards for leveling trainers;<br><br>
              •	Turning off AR makes hitting Pokémon with the Poke Ball easier, as they're always centered;<br><br>
              •	Holding the Poke Ball and waiting until immediately after a Pokémon has performed a dodge motion is a great way to hit the more elusive Pokémon;<br><br>
              •	You'll start getting Great Balls at Trainer Level 12, which will help you catch more rare Pokémon;<br><br>

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Candy Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Candy is arguably the most important resource in Pokémon Go, enabling you to Power Up and evolve your 
            Pokémon and thus strengthen them in the process.<br>
            It combines with Stardust to form arguably the central mechanic in the game outside of finding and 
            catching Pokémon themselves, but thankfully, there's many ways to get your hands on it, including when using the new Rare Candy item.<br><br>
            <strong>The best way to get Candy in Pokémon Go:</strong><br><br>
            As updates go on for the game, more and more methods of getting Candy exist, so it's worth keeping them all in mind as you play. It is, after all, one of the more difficult resources to collect.<br><br>
            <strong>Catching Pokémon:</strong><br><br>
            The best way is, unfortunately, through grinding out those catches.
            You'll get three Candy per Pokémon that you catch, and as part of the Gen 2 update, second and third tier evolutions will now give out more Candy in the 
            wild compared to their first evolution counterparts, increasing from 3 Candy to 5 and 10 respectively.<br>
            The second best way to get Candy is easier - by catching creatures.<br>
            There are ways to speed up the process for the creature you need, from finding Pokémon nests to finding Pokémon spawn locations.
            It's worth noting that, now and again, seasonal updates look to increase the rates of some drops, such as Candy during Pokémon Go's Halloween event, 
            so be sure to keep an eye on game updates to increase your stock.

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Gym Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            You can bring 6 Pokémon to Gym Battles, but you only have to battle 3. This makes your chances much better than you'd think.<br>
            Tap the lower right corner of the screen (the boxing glove) after tapping on a Gym to select 6 Pokémon.
            Use the Pokémon Go Pokémon Type Chart to plan the 6 Pokémon you intend to bring into a Gym Battle.<br><br>
            <strong>The main tips when you are at a Pokémon Gym:</strong><br><br>
            •	Your trainer level is hugely important in Gym battles, as it directly influences the evolution of your Pokémon to higher CP values;<br><br>
            •	If you're training at a friendly gym, your Pokémon will take damage, but they won't faint if they lose;<br><br>
            •	Gyms don't go down in one fell swoop. You have to wear them down by continually challenging and lowering their Prestige;<br><br>
            •	Special attacks against enemy Pokémon can leave your Pokémon vulnerable to counter-attack after launching.
            Reserve your special for a battle-ending finisher or when you are well-ahead;<br><br>
            •	Check Gyms out from a distance before attacking. They show up from very far away, and you can save yourself some trouble and sore feet by scouting them out;<br><br>
            •	You can't use the Pokémon that you've stationed at a Gym until it gets kicked out by another trainer;<br><br>
            •	Gym's aren't all about conquest! Friendly gyms allow you to train as well, adding Prestige to a Gym, (making it more powerful) and granting your trainer XP;<br><br>
            •	Joining a Gym is the only way to gain PokeCoins in Pokémon go without spending money, so it's extremely important;<br><br>
            •	If you're close to claiming a gym, try to keep the Pokémon you want to place in the gym out of battle if you're low on healing items or revives. 
            If it gets knocked out in battle and you're out of revives, you won't be able to station it in the gym;<br><br>
            •	Pokémon don't heal on their own...you'll need to use healing Items to restore them after battle;<br><br>
            •	Use the Weather to your advantage and pick Types that will get a boost. Gym Pokémon will also be boosted by the Weather so be careful;<br><br>

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Pokestops Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Pokemon Go Pokestops are locations which players can visit and receive free items. Players can also use Pokemon Go Pokestops to catch more Pokémon with a Lure module active.<br>
            These will be located at select places near you, such as historical markers, monuments, and art installations. <br>PokeStops are indicated on your map with blue icons, like the ones above. 
            When you're close enough to interact with the icon, it will change shape.
            <strong>There are some facts to note when we talk about Pokestops:</strong><br><br>
            •	Clicking on the icon will then allows you to swipe the Photo Disc, which will generate items in bubbles;<br><br>
            • Most often, a PokeStop will grant you three to four items at a time. Until you're level 5, PokeStops will grant you exclusively PokeBalls and Pokemon Eggs;<br><br>
            • Once you reach level 5, at times PokeStops will generate up to six PokeBalls, and other items such as Revives and Potions to use now that your trainer can access Gyms and battle other Pokemon;<br><br>
            <strong>PokeStops and Lure Modules:</strong><br><br>
            • If a player purchases one of the Lure Modules from the in-game Shop, the player can place a lure at any PokeStop to increase the amount of Pokemon who will gravitate to that area - 
            and this will benefit any other players in the area;<br><br>
            • You can even see when a PokeStop is under the influence of a Lure Module on the map by looking for the showering of pink petals, and interacting with the PokeStop will have an icon that details who used the lure;<br><br>
            • When combined with a Lure Module, PokeStops can be a great place to find pokemon - but some communties have created actual farming spots that can 
            churn out a near endless supply of pokemon and supplies - and you can too!;<br><br>

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Egg Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Pokémon Go isn't just about catching — hatching is a big part of the game as well. <br>You get Pokémon Go eggs from spinning Pokéstops and from friend Gifts, incubate them, 
            walk them for 2 KM, 5 KM, 7 KM, or 10 KM, and then hatch Pokémon from the common to the hyper-rare. Which Pokémon are in which Pokémon Eggs? 
            And what's the best — read: fastest! — way to hatch them? Here's the updated list along with some tips and tricks — and maybe a cheat or two!<br><br>
            <strong>What kind of Pokémon Eggs are there in Pokémon Go?</strong><br><br>
            Aside from the very different Lucky Eggs, available in the Shop, there are six kinds of Pokémon Eggs in Pokémon Go:<br><br>
            <strong>Catching Pokémon:</strong><br><br>
            • 2 KM Eggs with green spots;<br><br>
            • 5 KM Eggs (standard) with yellow spots;<br><br>
            • 5 KM Eggs* (Weekly Fitness 25 KM) with purple spots;<br><br>
            • 7 KM Eggs that are yellow with pink spots;<br><br>
            • 10 KM Eggs* (Weekly Fitness 50 KM) with purple spots;<br><br>
            Each type of Pokémon Egg can hatch different kinds of Pokémon and the potential Pokémon change periodically, along with the rates at which they hatch. 
            Also, some Pokémon can only hatch from Eggs picked up in specific regions.<br>
            Weekly Fitness reward Eggs are visually identical to the standard 5 KM and 10 KM Eggs received from Pokéstops but have a much smaller pool of potential Pokémon.

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Incense Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Incense are one of the most useful and rare items in Pokemon Go. They’re often given out at level-ups and they can be used to draw monsters to your location.<br>
            They’re great because they allow you to play stationary which can help you play indoors during rainy days or if you can’t make it outside.<br>
            Once you’ve activated your Incense, your Pokemon Go character will have a pinkish-purple mist swirling around them. 
            That indicates that the Incense is currently active. On top of that, you’ll see the Incense icon in the top right corner of the screen with a timer.<br>
            The core idea of an Incense is to bring Pokemon to your location. They are popular because Pokemon will show up without you having to go outside, move around, or do anything special.<br><br>
            <strong>There are a few fun facts to note when it comes to using Incense:</strong><br><br>
            •	Incense last for 30 minutes;<br><br>
            • Incense will draw random Pokemon to your location. They will not draw Pokemon that are on your “Nearby” map to where you are. You still have to go hunting for those;<br><br>
            • Pokemon will show up once every five minutes if you’re not moving. Thus, you can get about six chances to catch Pokemon every time you pop an incense;<br><br>
            • Since the only ways to get them is by leveling up or by using your Pokecoins, you’ll want to only use Incense on special occasions;<br><br>
            • Unlike Lures, Incense only work for you. Nobody else is going to see the Pokemon your Incense spawns on your screen;<br><br>
            • If you walk 200 meters every 5 minutes, your Incense will be more effective in attracting Pokémon;<br><br>
            • Incense is one of the best ways to draw Pokémon in for any funny or interesting snapshots you're hoping to collect;<br><br>

          <h3 class="subtitles" >Lure Tips</h3><br>
          <article>
            Pokémon Go Lures have been in the game since launch, but a new trio of Lure Modules - the Glacial Lure, Mossy Lure and Magnetic Lure - give you different creatures to catch.<br>
            Activate a Lure Module by clicking on a PokeStop and tapping the white button above the large circle you spin to get new items.
            Lure Modules have a tendency to show up at big gaming or entertainment culture shows and conventions.<br><br>    
            <strong>Three types of elemental Lure Module are available in the game:</strong><br><br>
            •	Glacial Lure Module - A frosty Lure Module that attracts Water and Ice Pokémon for 30 minutes;<br><br>
            • Magnetic Lure Module - An electronic Lure Module that attracts Electric, Steel and Rock Pokémon for 30 minutes;<br><br>
            • Mossy Lure Module - A natural Lure Module that attracts Bug, Grass and Poison Pokémon for 30 minutes.<br><br>
            <strong>Using a Lure provides three uses:</strong><br><br>
            1) Once used at a PokéStop, Pokémon of that type are more likely to spawn around that location.<br><br>
            2) Exclusive Pokémon can spawn at Lures. To date, there is only one Pokémon that debuted exclusively with a Lure enabled - Gen 5's Cryogonal, available during December 2019's holiday event using a Glacial Lure -
            but note that has been reported to no longer appear in lures and can spawn in (rare) snowy weather.<br><br>
            3) Each Lure can also offer special evolutions, some of which are exclusive. When in use, you can go to the respective pre-evolution and evolve it into the following:<br><br>
            • Magnetic Lure evolutions: Magnezone (from Magneton) and Probopass (from Nosepass);<br>
            • Mossy Lure evolutions: Leafeon (from Eevee);<br>
            • Glacial Lure evolutions: Glaceon (from Eevee);<br>
